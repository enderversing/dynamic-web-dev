            "Most people in the US will 'never amount to anything.' <br /><br />

            They won't be the best and the brightest because what they excel at
            doesn't fit the elite criteria of merit, because the traditional
            ladders of education and social services are being dismantled,
            because they consciously reject the paucity of a life spent in
            competition, or because they are just regular people, nothing
            special. <br /><br />

            But by celebrating the fact that "we'd never amount to anything,"
            the zine world does amount to something. It becomes a place where
            losers who have found their way into the underground can have a
            voice, a home, and others to talk to. <br /><br />

            As individuals, zinesters may be losers in the game of American
            meritocracy, but together they give the word "loser" a new meaning,
            changing it from insult to accolade, and transforming personal
            failure into an indictment of the alienating aspects of our
            society." <br /><br />
