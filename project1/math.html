            <h1><span>Math is the Original Game</span></h1>

            <p>Math is often associated with pain, discomfort, embarrassment, or shame. I feel, however, that math is a creative practice.
            <br><br>

            Exploring math should be as painless and joyful as exploring ceramics.
            <br><br>

            Similar to other art forms with an open ended nature, the open questions in math give us much room to play.
            <br><br>

            Math is a form of artistic expression, and should be as pleasurable to explore over an empty weekend as oil painting.</p>
            <p>

                Math is often associated with pain, discomfort, embarrassment, or shame because there are right and wrong answers.
                <br><br>

                Exploring math is often not as painless and joyful as exploring ceramics because of internal or external pressure to get the right answer as quickly possible.
                <br><br>


                This pressure to get answers right in a public setting turns many away from math before they even discover the fertile ground for exploration and personal growth.
                <br><br>


                The truth is, I enjoy the pressure. Math is like a game, where you can win or lose. It’s the original game.
            </p>

                In high school, my Calculus teacher literally turned our tests into games. Whoever got the highest score on the test would get bragging privileges. They would be crowned “King of the Test”.
                <br><br>

                Raph Koster proposes, in “A Theory of Fun for Game Design,” that the human experience of “fun” inside games is really the process of learning.
                <br><br>


                Thousands of years before you or I sat in our first math class, the Tchokwe people sat around the fire, drawing Eulerian graphs in the sand. Years before it was an individual expression of competence, math was a collective expression of belonging.
                <br><br>

                Researchers such as Greg Aloupis show that certain Nintendo games are as hard to beat as the most challenging, unsolved, open problems in mathematics. But math problems are free, and don’t require an expensive gaming console!
